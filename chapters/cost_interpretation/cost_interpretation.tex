\chapter{Cost interpretation}
The dynamic learner represents the dynamic map of the environment by the parameters in PMAC. These parameters are not directly usable by the localization and navigation systems so in order to provide a usable map to these subscribers an interpretation of the parameter values is necessary. The Interpretation in relation to the rest of the system is shown in figure \ref{fig:cost_overview}.

In the test platform used in this project the output required by the subscribing systems is a costmap. This grid represents the world as cells, each with a value for the cost of traversing it. 
The costmap is used for both navigation and localization but the type of obstacle used by the two systems are not entirely identical. The localization requires static obstacles while the navigation needs static as well as semi-static obstacles.
