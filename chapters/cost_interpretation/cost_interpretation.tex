\chapter{Cost Interpretation}
\ref{chapter:cost_interpretation}
This chapter describes how the learned dynamic behaviors of the environment can be converted to a map of good features and areas to avoid when navigating. Specifically the following aim is considered:

\begin{enumerate}
    \setcounter{enumi}{2}
    \item Improved localization with a continuously adapted map of good features
\end{enumerate}

The dynamic learner represents the dynamic map of the environment by the parameters in PMAC. These parameters are not directly usable by the localization and navigation systems. In order to provide a usable map to these subscribers an interpretation of the parameters is necessary. This is handled by the Cost interpretor which is shown in relation to the rest of the Dymamic mapping system in figure \ref{fig:cost_overview}.
