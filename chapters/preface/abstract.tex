\chapter*{Abstract}
This thesis deals with the problems of wrong localization and useless planned paths arising when navigating with mobile robots in dynamic environments with static maps.
We propose to solve this with a mapping server that maintains a consistent map by learning  dynamics from LIDAR measurements while considering uncertainties.
The mapping server is easily integrated as an addition to systems using a static map representation.
The mapping is done by incorporating measurements made over a short period with an inverse sensor model into a temporary occupancy grid.
The amount the inverse sensor model updates with is adjusted to represent the estimated pose uncertainty.
The temporary maps are used to estimate the parameters for the dynamics, which is represented as a grid of binary Markov processes.
The state transition parameters are estimated online by summing observations and events while considering the certainties in the temporary map.
Evaluation on a MiR-100 robot shows significantly improved localization when adding the proposed map server.
