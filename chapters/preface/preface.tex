\chapter*{Preface}
This project is developed at the Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller Institute of SDU by Martin Groth Albøge and Anders Birkehøj Jensen in collaboration with Mobile Industial Robot Aps(MiR)  as partial fulfilment of the requirements for graduation in MSc. Robot Systems. 
We would like to thank our supervisor at SDU Lars-Peter Ellekilde who has participated with analysis of the problem and ideas for solutions during many long meetings.
Likewise we would like to thank MiR for letting us use their facilities and robots.
We are especially grateful for the supervision and support we received by the CTO at MiR Niels Jul Jacobsen who have guided the direction of this project.
We are thankful for the many hours Niels has dedicated to meeting with us and helping us perform experiments.
Thanks to Rene Hannibalsen for letting us use the production area at SCAN A/S as use case and letting us use pictures and data taken there.
