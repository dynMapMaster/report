%\subsection{Prediction of Obstacles Location}
%When predicting five minutes out into the future in between updates a better match with the observed observation is achieved when using the proposed predict-update method, than when just predicting with the previously observed probability for occupied.
%It should be noted that these results are not general, since the accuracy of the prediction depends on the time between observations and how dynamic the observed obstacle are.
%
%\subsection{Localization with Dynamic Map}
%The estimation certainty of the localization performed by AMCL is smaller when using a dynamic map.
%
%Jumps in estimated position to an invalid pose is avoided.
%
%The accuracy and precision of the localization is better when using a dynamic map representation.
%The navigation system arrives faster at an accurate pose.
