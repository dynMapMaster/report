\section{MIR 100 platform}

Drives almost constantly with 5 km/h.

\subsection{LiDar}
LiDar in 16 cm height

Range = 30m

LiDar type: SICK S30B-2011ca

std. deviation = 1cm.

\subsection{AMCL localization}
MIR uses a ROS implementation of the adaptive monte carlo localization (AMCL), which uses a particle filter to track the pose of a robot against a known map (http://wiki.ros.org/amcl ). Today this is done by matching laser range scans with a static map. In dynamic environments with mismatch between the observed world and the map, the localization would be wrong. By adding semi static obstacles to the map the amount of mismatches is lowered, but location would still be wrong in highly unpredictable regions. It would be advantageous to identify these regions to take proper precautions.
