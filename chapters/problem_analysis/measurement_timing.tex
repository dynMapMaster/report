\section{Timing and measurements}

\subsection{Dependency of Measurements}
If Time scales on Laser scan measurements is much less than the time between movements, then it is very likely that consecutive measurements are the same. So when trying to observe whether obstacles have moved or not, each measurement is not very describing.
\subsection{Partial Observability}
When trying to model the dynamics of the environment it would be ideal to be able to observe the entire environment all the time to make sure all changes would be observed. This is of cause impossible in all but the most simple test setups and consequently this problem of partial observability must be considered and solved or at least, the effects of it should be minimized.

It is impossible to estimate the dynamic of an obstacle if it moves in between observations.
