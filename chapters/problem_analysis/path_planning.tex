\section{Path Planning in Dynamic Environments}

\subsection{Costmap in path planner}
Plans a path through a grid based map with the lowest possible cost. 
cost -> obstacles, obstacle vicenity, user-definements

MIR enables users to refine the static map by inserting costs that control the paths the robot follows. It is as an example possible to insert non-lethal or lethal obstacles in it. These user-preferences should also be present in a dynamic map.

\subsection{Ineffective Global Navigation in Static Maps}
Previously use static map in dynamic environments -> replan


Too much MIR
When the MIR100 navigates, it plans a global obstacle free path in the static map. In case the path goes through obstacles, since they are not present in the static map, the local planner will try to avoid the obstacle, while trying to follow the global path as good as possible. In some cases, the local planner might be stuck in a blocked corridor and hence recovery behaviors must try to find a solution. This is both ineffective and annoying for users (Kilde Niels). This can be avoided by adding observed obstacles to the static map, but by doing so the map might be cluttered with highly dynamic obstacles, which makes it impossible to plan a path. Therefore, the highly dynamic obstacles should not be included in the map.
