\section{Characteristics in industrial environments}
When mapping dynamic environment it is important to distinguish between objects.

 that certainly moves in between the robot parses it and objects that.
\subsection{Highly Dynamically Moving Objects}
60 seconds
Humans, animals, vehicles
Objects moving within the field of view of the robot.
\subsection{Semi-Static Obstacles}
Objects that moves without field of view of the object.
Parked vehicles, pallets, standing humans, doors, 
\subsection{Static Obstacles}
Steady for weeks
fixedly mounted equipment like a New wall, heavy machinery
Significant probability for observing a obstacle in the next observation.
