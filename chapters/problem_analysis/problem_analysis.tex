% \cite{tdoa_book}
This chapter investigates MIRâ€™s exiting software related to global maps of environments. The investigation is conducted by interviewing the CTO at MIR, Niels Jul Jacobsen and through experiments with the source code for MIR100. It reveals some inefficiencies in the current implementation where a static map is used for localization and navigation in a dynamic environment.
