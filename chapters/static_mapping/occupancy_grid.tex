\section{Occupancy grid mapping}

An initial decision in mapping is how to represent the environment. A widely used method is the occupancy grid map, described in [REFERENCE, ELFE?]. In this grid map each cell contains an occupancy value describing how occupied it is. Often 0 for completely free and 1 for completely occupied. 



Why occupancy grid ? (interface, recognised, used through put the community - considerations on other representation)

Mapping by inserting obstacle and free when observed.
