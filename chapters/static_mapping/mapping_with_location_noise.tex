\section{Mapping with Location noise}
AMCL
Scan map with location noise and AMCL
Considerations on noise. What types of noise are present. Estimation of the noise. Comparison between estimation and actual error (of bags) 
Non-ideal Inverse Sensor Model
From hector

Monte Carlo Integration Inverse Sensor Model 

Cone Sensor Model
Based on sonar model. Used to incorporate pose noise. 
Simulation of Mapping with Location Noise
Comparison
Efficiency - Computational price
Map Score (obstacle centered and whole map, adjusted for number of cells)
