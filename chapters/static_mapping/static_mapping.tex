\chapter{Static mapping}
% \cite{tdoa_book}
Static mapping is an essential part of mobile robotics. It forms the basics for allowing the robot to navigate the environment. 
Also in mapping dynamic environments the static mapping is en integral part. 

In this chapter different sensor models are evaluated. The effect of imperfect pose estimation is discussed and methods for incorporating various uncertainties are tested.
