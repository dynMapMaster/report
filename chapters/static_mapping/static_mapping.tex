\chapter{Mapping of Static environments}
This chapter investigates improved mapping of static environments with LIDAR sensors by incorporating sensor and localization noise. 
Specifically the following aim is considered:

\begin{enumerate}
    \setcounter{enumi}{0}
    \item Precise mapping of static environments by incorporating sensor and localization noise
\end{enumerate}

Mapping of static environments is an essential part of mobile robotics. It forms the basics for allowing the robot to navigate the environment. 
By integrating measurements with Bayes methods for a short period of time, where the local environment is likely to be static, the effects of sensor and localization errors can be reduced.
Figure \ref{fig:static_map_overview} shows the static mapping module in relation to the rest of the dynamic mapping system.
