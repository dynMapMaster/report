\section{Mapping an Industrial Environment}
\label{sec:mapping_at_scan}
The reduced ideal inverse sensor model good performance to map static obstacles have been verified by navigating a MiR-100 through the production line at SCAN A/S 19 times.
Figure \ref{fig:scan_overview_drawing} shows a part of the production area and the map that was created with Hector SLAM \cite{hector_slam} just before conducting the experiment.
The map is visualized with additive RGB colors where obstacles on the SLAM map is pure red. 
The map created with the reduced ideal model and the Elfes model shown in figure \ref{fig:sensor_model_std_dev01} is green and blue respectively.
The amount of color added is proportional to the estimated occupancy probability with none being certain free and saturated meaning certain occupancy. 
The green and blue colors indicates obstacles that was not present when mapping or wrongly positioned obstacles.
The green area in the lower left part of the map shows obstacles that was not present when performing SLAM, and the green area within the pallets to the right marks wrong estimates of occupancy.

The lack of blue influence on the edges of the pallets is most likely due to the Elfes inverse sensor model's very large clearing update values without consideration for localization errors.
The domination of yellow on the edges of the pallets facing towards the corridor where the robot navigated, indicates that the proposed integration of localization noise with the reduced ideal model with pose decay is appropriate for mapping.
