\section{Navigation in Dynamic Environments}
Mobile robot navigation is often done based on a costmap of the environment. This map represents the world as a grid of cells with associated costs. This cost is used to direct the search towards goal, along the path with the lowest cost. When the map is inconsistent with the environment, the robot might move into a dead end. This necessitates re-planning, thus wasting time. Because the map is never updated the robot might continue to plan into the same dead end, making the system inefficient and annoy users. By updating the costmap with the dynamic mapping system, it is possible to reduce the amount of these errors.
