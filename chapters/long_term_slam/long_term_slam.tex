\chapter{Long-term mapping in dynamic environments}
\label{long_term_mapping}
For a mobile robot to be able to function in an uncontrolled environment alongside other machines and humans, it is necessary for the robot to be able to sense and avoid the highly dynamic objects. All mobile robots navigating in such an area will have a system to handle these changes. Slower changes, however, that does not pose an immediate problem for the navigation of the environment are often disregarded. This is seen in the fact that often, a the map of the environment is only generated once and then used for an extended period of time. The assumption is that the surroundings does not change apart from the highly dynamical objects that should not be included in the map. This assumption can become increasingly flawed as time progressed due to the fact that most real world scenarios are not perfectly static. In an office, furniture might be moved around and in industrial settings, machines might be put up, or moved, or pallets stored in an area. As the discrepancy between the robot's internal representation and the actual environment increases, so does the chance for errors in localization or navigation. In order to overcome this, it is necessary for the robot to continue the process of mapping its environment as it navigates through it.
