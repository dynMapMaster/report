\chapter{Long-term Mapping of Dynamic Environments}
\label{long_term_mapping}

In order to maintain consistency between a map and a dynamic environment it is necessary to continuously update the map. Traditionally a map is build once but maintaining a map of a dynamic environment requires the mapping process to continue throughout the entire time of operation. This implies an interaction with the localization and navigation. 

A dynamic environment can be chaotic, with changing levels of dynamics or more ordered with dynamics being consistent over time and within areas. In this project the focus is on industrial environments.
This chapter discusses the challenges relating to navigation and localization in dynamic environments. An investigation into the characteristics of an industrial environment is also conducted in order to clarify the relevant properties for a dynamic mapping. Using existing SLAM algorithms for long-term mapping is also discussed.
