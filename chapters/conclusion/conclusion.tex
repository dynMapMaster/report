\chapter{Discussion and Conclusion}

Throughout this thesis a system was developed to handle the mapping, learning and representation of dynamic environments.
Specifically the aims of the thesis was:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Precise mapping of static environments by incorporating sensor and localization noise
	\item Long-term, fast, adaptive map representation of dynamic environments
	\item Improved localization with a continuously adapted map of good features
	\item Integration and evaluation on the MiR-100 platform
\end{enumerate}
